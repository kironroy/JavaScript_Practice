    <p>
      <b>Document Object Model (DOM)</b> is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that
      programs
      can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that
      way, programming languages can interact with the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript can manipulate the DOM in various ways, such as changing the content of an element, modifying styles,
      adding or
      removing elements, and handling events. This allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
    </p>
    <h3>Example of DOM Manipulation</h3>
    <p>
      <button id="changeBtn">Click Me</button>
    </p>

    <h2>Drawbacks of Direct DOM Manipulation</h2>

    <h3>State Management Chaos</h3>
    <p>When you manipulate the DOM directly, you're often juggling state in both the DOM and your JavaScript. This leads
      to
      inconsistencies and bugs—especially when multiple components or events interact.</p>

    <h3>Manual Syncing</h3>
    <p>You have to manually ensure the UI reflects the current app state. Forget one update, and your UI becomes stale
      or
      misleading.</p>

    <h3>Harder to Test and Maintain</h3>
    <p>DOM-dependent logic is tightly coupled to the structure of your HTML. Refactoring becomes risky, and unit testing
      is
      more difficult.</p>

    <h3>Performance Bottlenecks</h3>
    <p>The real DOM is relatively slow to update. Frequent changes (e.g., in animations or dynamic lists) can cause
      layout
      thrashing and reflows, which degrade performance.</p>
