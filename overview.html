    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul class="overview">
      <li>JavaScript is a high-level programming language that abstracts memory management through garbage collection,
        automatically reclaiming unused objects.</li>
      <li>It uses a prototype-based, object-oriented approach where nearly everything is treated as an object, except
        for
        primitive values like numbers and strings.</li>
      <li>Arrays and objects are created from blueprints; arrays originate from an array blueprint.</li>
      <li>JavaScript supports first-class functions, allowing functions to be passed as arguments or returned by other
        functions for enhanced flexibility.</li>
      <li>As a dynamically typed language, JavaScript does not require explicit type definitions for variables.</li>
      <li>Its concurrency model defines how the engine manages multiple tasks.</li>
      <li>JavaScript executes in a single thread and uses an event loop to handle time-consuming operations in the
        background, reintegrating them into the main thread upon completion.</li>
      <li>The JavaScript engine, such as the widely used V8 engine, executes JavaScript code.</li>
      <li>Modern JavaScript engines feature just-in-time compilation, converting the entire codebase into machine code
        instantaneously for execution.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Memory management</h2>
    <h3>Primitives</h3>
    <h4>Primitives are in the Call Stack (References to Objects)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Number</li>
      <li>String</li>
      <li>Boolean</li>
      <li>Undefined</li>
      <li>Null</li>
      <li>Symbol</li>
      <li>Big Int</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Objects</h3>
    <h4>Objects are in the heap</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Object literals</li>
      <li>Arrays</li>
      <li>Functions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For different type of values memory is allocated in different places.</p>
    <p>
    <ul class="overview">
      <li>JavaScript manages memory automatically through garbage collection, which reclaims memory from objects that
        are no longer in use.</li>
      <li>Developers can influence garbage collection by removing references to objects, allowing the engine to reclaim
        memory.</li>
      <li>Memory leaks can occur if references to unused objects are not removed, preventing garbage collection.</li>
      <li>Tools like Chrome DevTools can help identify and resolve memory leaks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Memory life cycle</h3>
    <p>
      A piece of memory is allocated when a variable is created, and it remains allocated until the variable goes out.
      Whenever a developer creates a variable, the JavaScript engine allocates memory for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>let x = 10;</code> allocates memory for the variable <code>x</code>.
    </p>
    <h3>Memory use</h3>
    <p>
      While code is running, the value is written, read and updated in the allocated piece of memory
    </p>
    <p><code>x = x + 6; round(x);</code></p>
    <h3>Release of Memory</h3>
    <p>When the variable is no longer needed the value is deleted from memory to free up resources.
      The released memory is used for new values
    </p>
    <p><b>Call Stack:</b> variable environment is simply deleted when Execution Context pops a variable off the stack
    </p>
    <p><b>Garbage Collection</b>is central memory management tool in any JavaScript engine. It acts automatically. 
      Developers cannot control when heap memory is cleaned by Garbage collection</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How much memory as app is using.</li>
        <li>Which engine is being used.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>All model JavaScript engine use a mark-and-swap algorithm</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Mark:</b>all objects that are reachable from a root as "alive."</li>
      <li><b>Sweep:</b>delete un-marked (unreachable) objects and reclaim memory allocations.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Memory Leaks</h3>
    <p>
      Memory leaks occur when objects are no longer needed by our application. Garbage collection 
      incorrectly tries to reach an object. Object is marked as alive.  This adds to clutter.
