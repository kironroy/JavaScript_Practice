    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul class="overview">
      <li>JavaScript is a <b>high-level programming language.</b> It abstracts memory management through garbage
        collection. Automatic reclaiming of unused objects.</li>
      <li>It is prototype-based. It uses an object-oriented approach. Almost everything is an object. The exceptions are
        primitive
        values: numbers and strings.</li>
      <li>Blueprints create arrays and objects. Arrays originate from an array blueprint.</li>
      <li>JavaScript supports first-class functions. Functions can pass as arguments or returned by other functions for
        enhanced
        flexibility.</li>
      <li>JavaScript is <b>dynamically typed</b>. No need to explicit type definitions for variables.
      </li>
      <li>Its concurrency model defines how the engine manages many tasks.</li>
      <li>JavaScript executes in a single thread. It uses an <b>event loop </b> to handle time-consuming operations in
        the
        background. Then it reintegrates them into the main thread upon completion.</li>
      <li>The <b>V8</b> engine, executes JavaScript code.</li>
      <li>Modern JavaScript engines use <b>just-in-time (JIT) compilation.</b> The entire code base converted into
        machine code. This
        happens fast.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Memory management</h2>
    <h3>Primitives</h3>
    <h4>Primitives are in the Call Stack (References to Objects)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Number</li>
      <li>String</li>
      <li>Boolean</li>
      <li>Undefined</li>
      <li>Null</li>
      <li>Symbol</li>
      <li>Big Int</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Objects</h3>
    <h4>Objects are in the heap</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Object literals</li>
      <li>Arrays</li>
      <li>Functions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For different type of values ➡️ Memory is allocated in different places.</p>
    <p>
    <ul class="overview">
      <li>It abstracts memory management through garbage collection. Automatic reclaiming of unused objects.</li>
      <li>Developers can influence garbage collection by removing references to objects. This allows the engine to
        reclaim
        memory.</li>
      <li>Memory leaks can occur if references to unused objects are not removed. Garbage collection cannot reclaim
        memory for these objects.</li>
      <li>Tools like Chrome DevTools can help identify and resolve memory leaks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Memory life cycle</h3>
    <p>
      Memory allocated when creating a variable. It remains allocated until the variable goes out. Whenever a developer
      creates a variable, the JavaScript engine allocates memory for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>let x = 10;</code> allocates memory for the variable <code>x</code>.
    </p>
    <h3>Memory use</h3>
    <p>
      While the code runs, it writes, reads, and updates values in the designated memory space.
    </p>
    <p><code>x = x + 6; round(x);</code></p>
    <h3>Release of Memory</h3>
    <p>When the variable is no longer needed the value gets deleted from memory to free up resources. The released
      memory used
      for new values.
    </p>
    <p><b>Call Stack:</b> variable environment is simply deleted when Execution Context pops a variable off the stack
    </p>
    <p>Garbage Collection: a central memory management tool in every JavaScript engine. It reclaims unused heap memory
      without
      developer control. Factors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How much memory as app is using.</li>
      <li>Which engine is being used.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All model JavaScript engine use a mark-and-swap algorithm.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Mark: </b>all objects that are reachable from a root as "alive."</li>
      <li><b>Sweep: </b>delete un-marked (unreachable) objects and reclaim memory allocations.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Memory Leaks</h3>
    <p>
      Memory leaks occur when objects are no longer needed by the application. Garbage collection tries to reach an
      object
      because the object marked as alive. This adds to clutter.
